# Belly-Button-Biodiversity
## Project Overview:
For this project, we were required to create a dashboard using Javascript to provide participants of a  biodiversity study visualize and understand the microbes found in their ***umbilicus***, aka "belly button".  Primarily, participants' will be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species inhabiting their navel while keeping their personal information confidential. 

**Diversity of cultured bacteria from belly buttons!**

## Results:
By the end of this project, I was able to:

- Create basic plots with Plotly, including bar charts, bubble charts, and guage charts.
- Used D3.json() to fetch external data, such as CSV files and web APIs.
- Parsed data in JSON format.
- Used functional programming in JavaScript to manipulate data.
- Used JavaScript's Math library to manipulate numbers.
- Used event handlers in JavaScript to add interactivity to a data visualization.
- Applied interactivity to enhance visualizations.
